**NOTE**: This is a fork of [sofn-xyz/mailing](https://github.com/sofn-xyz/mailing), which appears to now be abandonware, with significant modernization and improvements to the codebase. Major updates include:

- **React 19** and **Next.js 15** support
- **Pure ESM architecture** with **Vite integration** for 3.5x faster builds
- **Node.js 18+** requirement with modern JavaScript (ES2022)
- Security vulnerability fixes and dependency updates
- Improved build performance and developer experience

## ●&nbsp;&nbsp;Build, test, send emails with React

- Build email templates with React components [Examples](https://www.mailing.run/docs/templates)
- MJML components that work across clients (Outlook!)
- Preview server with live reload for quick development
- **Vite-powered builds** with 3.5x faster compilation times
- **Pure ESM architecture** for modern JavaScript performance
- Dev mode opens emails in your browser instead of sending
- Test mode for ensuring emails send and have the correct content
- Plays well with js frameworks like **Next.js 15**, redwood.js, remix
- Written in **TypeScript with ES2022** support, inspired by Action Mailer from Ruby on Rails

## ●&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?

We’re longtime users of Action Mailer and wanted something similar for our typescript/react apps. We didn’t find anything, so we decided to build Mailing. We added some features that we would’ve liked in Action Mailer, like a mobile toggle (with hotkeys), and the ability to send a test email from the browser while developing. We went all in on MJML so that we (almost) never have to think about email clients or nested tables :)

## ●&nbsp;&nbsp;Get started

Prerequisites: Mailing requires **Node.js 18+** and running on Mac or Linux. Windows is not supported at this time, but we'd welcome a pull request to [fix these bugs](https://github.com/sofn-xyz/mailing/issues/187) and add Windows support!

To get started with Mailing, check out the [official docs](https://www.mailing.run/docs).
