# Linting, duplication, and file size

- **Linting**: Treat all lints as errors. Do not disable or bypass rules; fix the root cause.
- **Config changes**: If a lint rule appears misconfigured, propose changes explicitly and get confirmation before altering config.
- **No duplication**: Extract reusable logic/types/components into shared modules instead of copying code.
- **File size**: Keep files â‰¤ 500 lines; split into smaller modules when growth approaches this limit.
