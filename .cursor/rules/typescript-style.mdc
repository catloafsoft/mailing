# TypeScript style and structure

- **Naming**: Use meaningful, descriptive identifiers; functions as verbs, variables as nouns; avoid abbreviations.
- **Types**: Explicitly annotate exported/public APIs; avoid `any` and unsafe casts; prefer `unknown` + type guards where needed.
- **Complex types**: Do not define complex types inline—extract and export from shared files for reuse.
- **Control flow**: Prefer early returns; handle error/edge cases first; avoid deep nesting beyond 2–3 levels.
- **Comments**: Keep minimal and purposeful; explain “why,” not “how.”
- **Structure**: Keep files small (≤ 500 lines). Extract shared logic into common utilities/modules instead of duplicating code.
- **ESM**: Use `import`/`export` consistently; do not use CommonJS syntax in TS.
